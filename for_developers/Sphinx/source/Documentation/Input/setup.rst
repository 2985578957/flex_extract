The Installation Script - ``setup.sh``
**************************************

.. _ref-setup:


The installation script ``setup.sh`` prepares the call of the Python 
installation script (``install.py``) with its necessary command line arguments. 
The ``setup.sh`` script is located in the root directory of ``flex_extract`` and has a 
section labelled with "AVAILABLE COMMANDLINE ARGUMENTS TO SET" which
contains the available command line parameters for ``install.py``. The user has to adapt these
parameters for his personal use. The parameters are listed and described in the following table.
The script also does some checks to guarantee necessary parameters were set.

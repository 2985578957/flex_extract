Ticket system
-------------
.. _ticket system: https://www.flexpart.eu/report/1

The community website http://flexpart.eu contains a 
`ticket system`_ which can be used to report any issue or a proposition for a new feature.

The tickets can be viewed by anyone, to create a ticket a registration is necessary. Since the automatic registration is unavailable, please send an email to the ``flexpart.eu[at]zamg.ac.at`` and you will receive your credentials (with some delay).  


.. _ref-mailing-list:

Mailing list
------------

The mailing list is mainly for the ``FLEXPART`` users to ask questions or share experiences regarding the whole ``FLEXPART`` process with the community. This can be a lot faster than asking only the developers for help. Since ``flex_extract`` is a preprocessor to ``FLEXPART`` this is the right place to ask for help.

Additionally, from time to time, there will be announcements for all FLEXPART users, such as new release versions of ``FLEXPART`` or ``flex_extract``. 

Just write a mail to: ``flexpart[at]lists.univie.ac.at``
